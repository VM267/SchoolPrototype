# Student Support AI Prototype

## Problem
Helping high school staff identify students who may benefit from supportive check-ins, using ethical, synthetic, and school-level data.

## Scope
- Synthetic student data only
- No protected categories
- Probabilistic support-likelihood scoring
- Staff-in-the-loop system, no automated action

## Demo Instructions
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run Streamlit: `streamlit run app/Home.py`
